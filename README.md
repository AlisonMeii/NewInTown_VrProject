# Abstract
&emsp;&emsp;This is an immersive English cross-cultural communication scene roaming based on VR all-in-one machine. Through the VR simulation of the language environment of a foreign cafe, we create an immersive environment, and are committed to providing users with a platform to practice English in four aspects: listening, speaking, reading and writing, which is not boring and creative.

# 1. Project Introduction
## 1.1 Design Ideas
&emsp;&emsp;This application chooses English learning as the theme. Meanwhile, a double-storey cafe was designed and modelled by the team members, plus information collection and discussion. We divided the application into two main parts, one is **scene roaming** and the other is **fun interactive learning**.  
&emsp;&emsp;In terms of **scene roaming**, we have created an original scene design and added a number of scene interaction points to create a real atmosphere, making players feel like they are in the real world.  
&emsp;&emsp;In terms of **fun interactive learning**, we start from the four aspects of **listening**, **speaking**, **reading** and **writing**, which are common in English learning, and design fun and interactive functions:  
- :speech_balloon:**Speaking practice**:Speaking exercises can be triggered with non-player characters in specific areas of the scene;
- :books:**Reading practice**:Look for items in the scene such as computer/ipad and click on them to see an English article (classic beauty/real-time news), which the player needs to finish reading;
- :ear:**Listening practice**:The scene is set up with a listen button that the player can click on to listen intently to the dialogue we have set up for the non-player character (the material is taken from the two-person dialogue in the listening test);
- :pencil2:**Spelling practice**：Daily Proverb boards at the entrance to the café; and crossword puzzles on the big screen in the screening room on the first floor.
