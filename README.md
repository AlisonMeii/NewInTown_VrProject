# Abstract
&emsp;&emsp;This is an immersive English cross-cultural communication scene roaming based on VR all-in-one machine. Through the VR simulation of the language environment of a foreign cafe, we create an immersive environment, and are committed to providing users with a platform to practice English in four aspects: listening, speaking, reading and writing, which is not boring and creative.

# 1. Project Introduction
## 1.1 Design Ideas
&emsp;&emsp;This application chooses English learning as the theme. Meanwhile, a double-storey cafe was designed and modelled by the team members, plus information collection and discussion. We divided the application into two main parts, one is **scene roaming** and the other is **fun interactive learning**.  
&emsp;&emsp;In terms of **scene roaming**, we have created an original scene design and added a number of scene interaction points to create a real atmosphere, making players feel like they are in the real world.  
&emsp;&emsp;In terms of **fun interactive learning**, we start from the four aspects of **listening**, **speaking**, **reading** and **writing**, which are common in English learning, and design fun and interactive functions:  
- :speech_balloon:**Speaking practice**:Speaking exercises can be triggered with non-player characters in specific areas of the scene;
- :books:**Reading practice**:Look for items in the scene such as computer/ipad and click on them to see an English article (classic beauty/real-time news), which the player needs to finish reading;
- :ear:**Listening practice**:The scene is set up with a listen button that the player can click on to listen intently to the dialogue we have set up for the non-player character (the material is taken from the two-person dialogue in the listening test);
- :pencil2:**Spelling practice**：Daily Proverb boards at the entrance to the café; and crossword puzzles on the big screen in the screening room on the first floor.
## 1.2 Application Innovation Points
&emsp;&emsp;① **Thematic creativity** that focuses on language application for intercultural communication rather than limiting itself to learning and test scoring. Focus on the actual use of the language scene, pay attention to the details and authentic expression of the silent immersion, so as to promote the application of thematic innovation.  
&emsp;&emsp;② **Content creativity**, traditional classroom teaching lacks practical opportunities, and the strict grading system gives people a strong sense of pressure. This product breaks through the tradition and provides an immersive VR environment. Users can practice speaking, listening, reading and vocabulary in the virtual scene. Unlike theoretical learning, this product combines theory and practice. Users not only learn grammar, but more importantly, use English more in the virtual environment, master better expression ability, and learn to express themselves more authentically;  
&emsp;&emsp;③ **UI creativity**, purely original UI design, set up original logos, labels, slogans, patterns, etc., unified style and colour, systematic integrity is good, and strive to create a more close to the scene style and suitable for the VR scene of the UI design;  
&emsp;&emsp;④ **Technical creativity**, the use of PICO equipment development, clever use of handle buttons, so that the user has a more immersive feeling; another random and challenges, high playability, interesting, interactive experience.
